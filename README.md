Subject: Urgent: Clarification Needed Regarding NOC Timeline

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I trust this message finds you well. I wish to discuss a crucial matter concerning the timeline for issuing the No Objection Certificate (NOC) in relation to my impending departure.

In our earlier discussions, we had mutually agreed that the NOC would be provided before the commencement of my final working week, which is set to conclude on August 31st. This understanding was reached after I shared my financial concerns and situation with you.

However, recent communication has indicated a potential delay, with the NOC being issued only on my last working day. This revised timeline poses significant challenges for me, particularly given the subsequent processes that need to be completed, such as obtaining the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) and undergoing the Labor Ministry's approval procedure. The extended duration involved could potentially lead to a prolonged period without salary, a situation we had previously discussed as a concern.

In light of these developments, I kindly seek your cooperation and assistance in ensuring that the initially agreed-upon NOC issuance date, which is before my last working week, remains unchanged. This timeline is critical for me to facilitate a seamless transition to my new endeavor without enduring undue financial hardships.

Your understanding and support in this matter are immensely valued. I sincerely appreciate your prompt attention and look forward to resolving this situation in the best possible manner.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
