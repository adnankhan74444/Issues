Subject: Urgent: Clarification Regarding NOC Timeline and Potential Implications

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss a matter of significant concern regarding the No Objection Certificate (NOC) timeline and its potential implications.

As previously discussed, I informed both my current and prospective employers about the NOC timeline that we had agreed upon. This timeline was integral to my decision to resign from my current position in pursuit of a new opportunity.

Recently, I was notified that the NOC's approval process is still pending with the management. This situation raises concerns about the potential risk of missing out on the new opportunity and the possible impact on my career trajectory.

While I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, I am reaching out to seek clarity and to understand the actions being taken to expedite the NOC approval process. I believe that proactive communication and collaboration can help address this situation and potentially mitigate any negative outcomes.

I appreciate your understanding of the gravity of this matter and your assistance in finding a resolution. Your prompt response would be highly valued in alleviating my concerns.

Thank you for your attention and support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
