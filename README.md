rjSubject: Urgent: Timely Release of NOC Request

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you are well. I need to urgently address the NOC release timeline. Our previous understanding was for the NOC to be issued in the last week before my departure. I've informed my next employer accordingly.

However, I recently received communication that the NOC would only be provided on my last working day. This delay could jeopardize my new opportunity.

I kindly request your assistance in ensuring the NOC's timely release as initially agreed, helping me honor my commitments. Your prompt attention is greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
