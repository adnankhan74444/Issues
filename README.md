Subject: Urgent: Clarification Needed Regarding NOC Timeline

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to revisit our previous discussions regarding the No Objection Certificate (NOC) and its issuance timeline.

Before submitting my resignation, I had a detailed conversation with you, during which I also shared my financial situation. Based on our discussion, it was agreed that the NOC would be provided prior to my last working week, specifically around the end of August.

However, I have recently received information that the NOC might only be issued on my last working day. I need to stress that this timeline poses significant challenges for me. Once I receive the NOC, I would need to apply for the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC), and subsequently, the request would need to be processed by the Labor Ministry. This extended process could potentially result in a considerable period without a salary, which I had discussed with you as a concern.

Given the circumstances, I kindly request your support in ensuring that the NOC is indeed issued by the agreed-upon date of August 31st. This timeline is crucial for me to seamlessly transition to my new opportunity without undue financial strain.

Your assistance and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your prompt attention.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
